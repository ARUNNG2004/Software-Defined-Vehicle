# Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to NVIDIA for providing the Jetson platform and libraries, which have made projects like this possible. Their commitment to democratizing access to AI technology has inspired countless developers and makers.

Additionally, I appreciate the support from the open-source community, whose contributions and shared knowledge have significantly aided in the development of this project. Special thanks to the contributors of the Jetson.GPIO library for their valuable work that allows for seamless GPIO control on NVIDIA devices.
